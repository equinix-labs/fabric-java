       The API will accept either a single facility `{ "facility": "f1" }`, or it can be instructed to create the device in the best available datacenter `{ "facility": "any" }`.
 
       Additionally it is possible to set a prioritized location selection. For example `{ "facility": ["f3", "f2", "any"] }` can be used to prioritize `f3` and then `f2` before accepting `any` facility. If none of the facilities provided have availability for the requested device the request will fail.

      The current state the instance is in.

      * When an instance is initially created it will be in the `queued` state until it is picked up by the provisioner.
      * Once provisioning has begun on the instance it's state will move to `provisioning`.
      * When an instance is deleted, it will move to `deprovisioning` state until the deprovision is completed and the instance state moves to `deleted`.
      * If an instance fails to provision or deprovision it will move to `failed` state.
      * Once an instance has completed provisioning it will move to `active` state.
      * If an instance is currently powering off or powering on it will move to `powering_off` or `powering_on` states respectively. 
      * When the instance is powered off completely it will move to the `inactive` state.
      * When an instance is powered on completely it will move to the `active` state.
      * Using the reinstall action to install a new OS on the instance will cause the instance state to change to `reinstalling`.
      * When the reinstall action is complete the instance will move to `active` state.

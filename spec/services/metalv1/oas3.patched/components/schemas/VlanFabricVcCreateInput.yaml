  metro:
    description: A Metro ID or code. When creating Fabric VCs (Metal Billed), this is where interconnection will be originating from, as we pre-authorize the use of one of our shared ports as the origin of the interconnection using A-Side service tokens. 
      We only allow local connections for Fabric VCs (Metal Billed), so the destination location must be the same as the origin. For Fabric VCs (Fabric Billed), or shared connections, this will be the destination of the interconnection. We allow remote connections for Fabric VCs (Fabric Billed), 
      so the origin of the interconnection can be a different metro set here.

  service_token_type:
    description: Either 'a_side' or 'z_side'. Setting this field to 'a_side' will create an interconnection with Fabric VCs (Metal Billed). Setting this field
      to 'z_side' will create an interconnection with Fabric VCs (Fabric Billed). This is required when the 'type' is 'shared', but this is not applicable when the 'type' is 'dedicated'.
      This parameter is included in the specification as a developer preview and is generally unavailable. Please contact our Support team for more details.

  speed:
    description: |-
      A interconnection speed, in bps, mbps, or gbps. For Fabric VCs, this represents the maximum speed of the interconnection. For Fabric VCs (Metal Billed), this can only be one of the following: 
      ''50mbps'', ''200mbps'', ''500mbps'', ''1gbps'', ''2gbps'', ''5gbps'' or ''10gbps'', and is required for creation. For Fabric VCs (Fabric Billed), this field will always default to ''10gbps'' even if it is not provided.
      For example, ''500000000'', ''50m'', or' ''500mbps'' will all work as valid inputs.

    description: A list of one or two metro-based VLANs that will be set on the virtual circuits of primary

      VLANs can also be set after the interconnection is created, but are required to fully activate the virtual circuits.

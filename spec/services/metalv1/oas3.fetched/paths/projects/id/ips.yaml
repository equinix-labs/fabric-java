  description: Request more IP space for a project in order to have additional IP
    addresses to assign to devices.  If the request is within the max quota, an IP
    reservation will be created. If the project will exceed its IP quota, a request
    will be submitted for review, and will return an IP Reservation with a `state`
    of `pending`. You can automatically have the request fail with HTTP status 422
    instead of triggering the review process by providing the `fail_on_approval_required`
    parameter set to `true` in the request.

# Deprecated

This project is deprecated and replaced by [equinix-sdk-java](https://github.com/equinix/equinix-sdk-java).

Equinix made a decision to have a single unified SDK for all of your Equinix Developer Interface needs with Java.

Currently, this SDK is up to date with Fabric 4.21 API Spec. The final update will be to sync this SDK
with the Fabric 4.23 API Spec in August 2025. After that please move to equinix-sdk-java for your Go SDK
needs with Equinix.
